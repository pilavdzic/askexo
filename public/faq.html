				<p class="message user-message">How does this site work?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">This system utilizes the OpenAI API to provide responses to user queries. Given the potential for unreliable factual outputs from GPT-3, the system first identifies relevant sections of the regulations and appends them to the user's query. By instructing GPT-3 to refer to these selected regulations when generating its response, the system produces more accurate and targeted responses than GPT-3 would otherwise provide.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="message user-message">Which sets of regulations are used in the embeddings?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">At present, the system uses the FAM, FAH, and ADS.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="message user-message">Are these responses completely accurate?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">No. Although the use of embeddings makes these responses more accurate than what GPT-3 would otherwise provide, they can still contain factually incorrect information.  You should double-check the accuracy of the responses provided.</p>
