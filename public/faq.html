				<p class="message user-message">How does this site work?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">This system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to give responses to user queries.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="message user-message">How is this site different from ChatGPT?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">This system contains a library of pre-formatted excerpts from the relevant regulations.  Behind the scenes, the system picks one or more relevant policies from among that library, appends it to your query, and then directs GPT-4 to refer to that particular text when formulating its response.  The result should usually be more focused and accurate than you would get if you put the same query into ChatGPT.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="message user-message">Which sets of regulations are in the library?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">Right now, the library contains portions of the Foreign Affairs Manual.  In the future it will contain other related sets of regulations, such as the FAH, DSSR, ADS, AIDAR, etc.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="message user-message">Are the responses this system gives completely accurate?</p>
				<p class="message response-message">Not always!  The responses should usually cite specific regulations, which you can use to double-check their accuracy.</p>
