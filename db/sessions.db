Contract fares are identifiable because normally the fare designator \"YCA\" is reflected. The ticket will show a three-letter fare basis code with CA (Contract Award) as part of it. Fiscal year contract fares are provided for informational purposes on the City Pair Program website. Fares will also be listed at time of booking through your agency's E-Gov Travel Service (ETS) booking channel.\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: What are the advantages of the program? The City Pair Program provides the following core benefits: No advance purchases required; No minimum or maximum length of stay required; Fully refundable tickets and no charge for cancellations or changes; No capacity controlled YCA fare seating. If there is a coach class seat on the plane, the traveler can purchase it; No blackout dates; Locked-in fares to facilitate travel budgeting; Significant discounts over regular walk-up fares; and\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: Can Military Reservists use City Pair fares to attend Inactive Duty Training (IDT)? To attend Inactive Duty Training (IDT), reservists can use the City Pair fares. In order to use City Pair fares, reservists must have a GSA SmartPay® Travel Card issued by their commanding officer. Once the official government travel card has been received, reservists must contact the Commercial Travel Office (CTO) at their base or duty station to make travel reservations.\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: Who must use the City Pair Program?

Please refer to the annual contract for a full list of mandatory users.\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: Do Contractors follow the same rules as government employees on travel? Per FTR 301-10.111 Note 3, contractors are not authorized to use contract city pair fares to perform travel under their contracts. GSA cautions agencies that the purchase of contract fare tickets on behalf of contractors is a misuse of the CPP. In addition, invitational travel orders and the agency's Centrally Billed Account (CBA) should not be issued or used to allow contractors access/use of Contract City Pair fares. The numbering sequence on the government charge card indicates official government employee travel. If a contractor's commercial fare is put on a CBA, the CBA identifies the traveler as eligible for City Pair contract fares.\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: Can I combine two contract fares to save money? Generally, no. If there is already a contract fare from the origin to the end destination, other contract fares may not be combined to circumvent the award already made. However, if there is no contract fare for the route (again, origin to final destination), other contract fares may be combined. In fact, if there is no contract fare, a combination of contract fares and/or any other available fare may be used so that the price results in the lowest cost alternative to the government and meets the traveler's needs.\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: Does policy state that I have to fly out of a certain airport? In accordance with FTR 301-10.110, federal employees on official travel must choose the City Pair contract carrier if the contract carrier fare is offered and has seats available. Travelers should utilize the contract carrier from the airport that offers established City Pair fares. If multiple sister airports (i.e. IAD, DCA, BWI are considered sister airports) offered on the city pair or a lower airfare is found, a traveler should always review its agency's internal travel policies to ensure they incorporate the use of both CPP contract and non-contract air carriers in a way that results in an overall cost savings to the federal government.\nUS General Services Administration FAQs for City Pair Program: Can I be bumped from a flight when traveling on official travel on a contract fare? When you use either the YCA or _CA fare you are processed by the airline just as any other passenger using a commercial fare. Contract airlines cannot discriminate against government travelers just because they are traveling at the City Pair fare. However, a government traveler cannot receive preferential consideration just because they are a government employee.

The following are possible exceptions to the mandatory use of a contract air carrier: (1) The contract carrier’s flight schedule is inconsistent with the performance of a mission-critical, official duty; (2) The contract carrier is sold out or does not offer service on your authorized date of travel;    NOTE: For travel that is not date-specific (e.g., permanent-change-of- station [PCS]), travelers are expected to schedule their trips on dates when the contract carrier offers service if the difference in cost between using a noncontract carrier (with either public fares or nonpublic government fares) on the preferred date of travel and the cost of using the contract carrier on the next date it offers service is substantial;    NOTE: When travel is date-specific (e.g., temporary duty (TDY)) but not critically urgent (e.g., medical evacuation (MEDEVAC)) and a traveler is away from their permanent duty station, additional per diem costs caused by waiting for the next day that the contract carrier offers service must exceed the difference between the cost of a ticket on the contract carrier on the next day it offers service and the cost of a ticket on a noncontract carrier on the authorized date of travel for this exception to apply; (3) The contract carrier cannot accommodate your pet(s) as an in-cabin pet, as accompanied baggage, or as checked cargo on the same flight as you, or in the case of codeshare flights, the operating carrier will not accept your pet(s) as an in-cabin pet, as accompanied baggage, or as checked cargo if the flight is booked using the codeshare flight number of a U.S. carrier;    NOTE: When pet movement is the determining factor for non-use of the contract carrier, the traveler is responsible for airfare exceeding the YCA city-pair fare and for the actual cost of moving the pet(s); (4) The contract carrier’s flight schedule is inconsistent with the provisions of 14 FAM 581.1 with regard to scheduling travel during the employee's regularly scheduled workweek;    NOTE: This exception does not apply to international travel; (5) A noncontract carrier offers a public (nongovernment) fare that is less expensive and has the same restrictions as the fare on the contract carrier;    NOTE: Noncontract fares that are limited to U.S. Government travelers on official business (e.g., _DG, Category Z (_MZ), and similar fares) are not public fares and cannot be used to demonstrate cost savings against a contract carrier fare. b. A valid exception to the mandatory use of a contract carrier does not confer an exception to the Fly America Act. When a traveler is authorized an exception to the mandatory use of a contract carrier, the noncontract carrier used must be Fly America Act compliant unless an exception to the Fly America Act also applies. See 14 FAM 583 for exceptions. c. When a traveler is authorized use of a noncontract carrier in accordance with one of the exceptions above (other than the “lower fare” exception in 14 FAM 542.1, subparagraph a(5), government fares (e.g., _DG, _MZ, etc.) should be used on the noncontract carrier if they provide the lowest cost. d. Traveler preference (e.g., for a non-stop flight, particular air carrier, routing, connecting city, connection length, or journey duration) is not a valid exception to the mandatory use of a contract air carrier. e. Availability or nonavailability of seat assignments or upgrades are not valid exceptions to the mandatory use of a contract air carrier.\nADS 522.3.15 Mandatory Use of Direct Routes and Deviations for Personal Convenience   Effective Date: 05/22/2012 All official TDY travel must be on a direct route (also known as a usually traveled route) (see FTR 301-10.7 and 14 FAM 585.1). Contract carrier city-pair fares provide direct routes. When, for personal convenience, a traveler interrupts travel on a direct route or travels by an indirect route, the traveler must bear any additional costs incurred as a result  (see FTR 301-10.8, 14 FAM 585.2-1, and 14 FAM 585.2-2). Reimbursement will be limited to the cost of traveling on a direct route or on an uninterrupted travel would have cost.   \n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"\n\nBased on the relevant regulations provided, traveling with a pet may affect the rules on city pair fares if the contract carrier cannot accommodate the pet(s) as an in-cabin pet, as accompanied baggage, or as checked cargo on the same flight as the traveler or in the case of codeshare flights, the operating carrier will not accept the pet(s) as an in-cabin pet, as accompanied baggage, or as checked cargo if the flight is booked using the codeshare flight number of a U.S. carrier (14 FAM 542.1(a)(3)). In this case, the traveler is responsible for airfare exceeding the YCA city-pair fare and for the actual cost of moving the pet(s) (14 FAM 542.1(a)(3), Note). It is important to note that traveler preference for a non-stop flight, particular air carrier, routing, connecting city, connection length, or journey duration is not a valid exception to the mandatory use of a contract air carrier, and availability or nonavailability of seat assignments or upgrades are not valid exceptions to the mandatory use of a contract air carrier (14 FAM 542.1(d)-(e)).

Under the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA), regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, health care providers generally will not release patient information to MED unless authorized by the patient or a legal representative. Therefore, the patient or a designated personal representative must authorize the attending physician or hospital to release the patient’s information to MED using an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (suggested template is located in 3 FAH-1 Exhibit H-3742.1, Required Medical EVT Documentation). Other formats may be used for HIPAA authorizations, and an employee or spouse or domestic partner (as defined in 3 FAM 1610) will need to defer to the hospital or other health care provider if they have particular policies or procedures regarding the release of medical information; the language that must be included in a valid authorization under HIPAA is listed under 45 CFR 164.508(c). The determination of “personal representative” under HIPAA is governed by 45 CFR 164.502(g). The patient or personal representative must sign and date a HIPAA-compliant authorization, and send it to the family member’s physician or hospital in order for MED to request patient information. Upon receipt of the authorization, the physician or hospital will be permitted to respond to MED’s request for patient information. This authorization is essential to the medical EVT process. b. If MED is not able to contact the treating physician or hospital or if the care providers refuse to share necessary medical information about the immediate family member, MED cannot confirm the family member’s health status and will not recommend authorization of medical EVT to post. In this case, the patient or patient’s personal representative must identify and authorize another physician to release the medical information to MED and provide the physician’s contact information to MED, or direct other family members to do so.\nContext: VISITATION TRAVEL, RESPONSIBILITIES; Regulation: 3 FAM 3734 RESPONSIBILITIES (Uniform State/USAID/USAGM/Commerce/Foreign Service Corps/USDA) (Applies to Foreign Service Employees Only) In Washington, the interpretation of these uniform regulations is the responsibility of: StateOffice of Employee Relations (GTM/ER) USAIDOffice of Human Resources (HR) USAGMOffice of Personnel (M/P) CommerceOffice of Foreign Service Human Resource; USDA/FASForeign Agricultural Affairs, International Services Staff In the field, these regulations are to be administered uniformly.
